Dear Teams,

Considering the fact that foundation construction is about to start and most teams are currently working hard on the final construction drawings, we have decided to extend the D-9 deliverable due date for four weeks. The updated due date for D-9 is Thursday, 26 April 2018, 5:30 PM Beijing Time.

Attached please find the most up to date Deliverable Sheet.

Sincerely,

Solar Decathlon China organizers
